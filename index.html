<p>The PREP pipeline is a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline that focuses on the identification of bad channels and the calculation of a robust average reference. PREP also has an extensive reporting facility. It is designed to be run in a completely automated way. The major sections of this document are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction (requirements, citing, installation)</li>
<li>Algorithm (steps, meaning of parameters for each step)</li>
<li>Running as an EEGLAB plug-in</li>
<li>Running as a script</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h3>

<p>The PREP pipeline relies on the MATLAB Signal Processing toolbox and EEGLAB, a freely-available MATLAB toolbox for processing EEG. EEG is available from  <a href="http://scn.ucsd.edu/eeglab">http://scn.ucsd.edu/eeglab</a>. PREP assumes that the EEG data is provided as an EEGLAB EEG structure and that channel locations are provided in the EEG.chanlocs structure.</p>

<p>This section discusses the algorithm and the meeting of the various parameters.</p>

<h2>
<a id="boundary-marker-handling" class="anchor" href="#boundary-marker-handling" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Boundary marker handling</h2>

<p>PREP is meant to work on data obtained from a continuous recording session. However, sometimes researchers record multiple sessions in the same file (such as by temporarily suspending and resuming recording). EEGLAB uses boundary events to mark
these discontinuities. Some (but not all) EEGLAB functions respect these boundary markers. By default, the PREP pipeline will not process data sets with boundary markers. Because some researchers use these boundary markers for other purposes than for marking discontinuities, PREP allows the option of temporarily removing boundary markers before processing and then reinserting afterwards. <strong>You should not disregard boundary markers unless you are absolutely sure that these markers</strong>
<strong>to not represent discontinuities.</strong></p>

<h2>
<a id="detrend-high-pass-filtering" class="anchor" href="#detrend-high-pass-filtering" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Detrend (high pass filtering)</h2>

<p>High pass filtering of some sort is needed in order for many of the algorithms, including line noise removal and
referencing to perform correctly. However, the exact cutoff may dramatically effect downstream algorithms. By default, 
PREP uses a 1 Hz cutoff, but only temporarily filters, so that the final signal is not high-pass filtered. This
allows you to defer the final choice of high pass cutoff for downstream processing to later. </p>

<h3>
<a id="calling-sequence-for-removing-trends" class="anchor" href="#calling-sequence-for-removing-trends" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Calling sequence for removing trends</h3>

<p>The <code>removeTrend</code> function takes two structures in and produces two output structures. The <code>signal</code> structure
includes a <code>.data</code> field and an <code>.srate</code> field. The <code>signal</code> structure is compatible with an EEGLAB EEG structure, but does not rely on any of the other EEGLAB fields. The <code>.data</code> field should be channels x frames. </p>

<p>As with all functions in the pipeline, the algorithm parameters are passed in a structure.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>[signal, detrendOut] = removeTrend(signal, detrendIn)</code><br>
<code>[signal, detrendOut] = removeTrend(signal)</code>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The output structure contains all of the input structure fields plus additional fields including a string representation
of the actual command used.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>lineNoiseIn = struct('lineNoiseChannels', [1:32, 40:60], 'lineFrequencies', [60, 120, 180, 212, 240]);</code>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a id="parameters-for-removing-the-trend" class="anchor" href="#parameters-for-removing-the-trend" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parameters for removing the trend</h3>

<p>The following parameters appear as fields in the <code>detrendIn</code> structure:  </p>

<p><strong><code>detrendChannels</code></strong><br>
 A row vector specifying the channel numbers of the channels to remove the trend from.<br>
By default, PREP uses all of the channels (<code>1:size(signal.data, 1)</code>). 
If your signal has extraneous or unused channels, you should specify which channels to use.  </p>

<p><strong><code>detrendType'</code></strong><br>
The type of detrending operation to perform. At this time the options are 'high pass', 'high pass sinc', 'linear', and
'none'. By default, PREP uses 'high pass' by calling 'pop_eegfiltnew' with the default settings. The
'high pass sinc' setting calls 'pop_firws' with a blackman window type. The 'linear' filter is adapted
from the Chronux toolbox and uses local linear regression. The window size is <code>1.5/detrendCutoff</code>. Generally,
the 'linear' option is much slower than simple high pass filtering and gives very similar results.
Usually you don't have to specify this parameter.  </p>

<p><strong><code>detrendCutoff'</code></strong><br>
The cutoff frequency in Hz for high pass filtering or local detrending. By default, PREP uses 1 Hz. Usually you don't have to specify this parameter.</p>

<p><strong><code>detrendStepSize</code></strong><br>
The amount in seconds to slide the local detrending window when local linear regression is used for detrending. 
By default, PREP uses 0.02 seconds. This parameter is not used unless the <code>detrendType</code> is 'linear'.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="line-noise-removal" class="anchor" href="#line-noise-removal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Line noise removal</h2>

<p>We use an iterative version of the a method that estimates the amplitude and size of a deterministic sinusoid at a specified frequency embedded in locally white noise. The model is applied in sliding windows to adjust for non stationarity. The deterministic frequencies to be removed must be specified to within a small range. By default, the line noise removal (<code>cleanLineNoise</code>) attempts to removal multiples of 60 Hz. You might need to rerun with different frequencies if unusual spectral peaks are visible in the reports. </p>

<h3>
<a id="calling-sequence-for-line-noise-removal" class="anchor" href="#calling-sequence-for-line-noise-removal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Calling sequence for line noise removal</h3>

<p>The <code>cleanLineNoise</code> function takes two structures in and produces two output structures. The signal structure
includes a <code>.data</code> field and an <code>.srate</code> field. The <code>signal</code> structure is compatible with an EEGLAB EEG structure, but does not rely on any of the other EEGLAB fields. The data field should be channels x frames. </p>

<p>As with all functions in the pipeline, the algorithm parameters are passed in a structure.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>[signal, lineNoiseOut] = cleanLineNoise(signal, lineNoiseIn)</code><br>
<code>[signal, lineNoiseOut] = cleanLineNoise(signal)</code>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The output structure contains all of the input structure fields plus additional fields containing information on the
tapers used to compute the spectral components and additional fields including a string representation
of the actual command used.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>lineNoiseIn = struct('lineNoiseChannels', [1:32, 40:60], 'lineFrequencies', [60, 120, 180, 212, 240]);</code>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
<a id="parameters-for-line-noise-removal" class="anchor" href="#parameters-for-line-noise-removal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parameters for line noise removal</h3>

<p>The following parameters appear as fields in the <code>lineNoiseIn</code> structure:  </p>

<p><strong><code>lineNoiseChannels</code></strong><br>
 A row vector specifying the channel numbers of the channels to remove line noise from.  By default, PREP uses all of the channels (<code>1:size(signal.data, 1)</code>). If your signal has extraneous or unused channels, you should specify which channels to use.</p>

<p><strong><code>Fs</code></strong><br>
The sampling frequency of the signal in Hz. By default, PREP uses the sampling rate specified in <code>signal.srate</code>. Usually you don't have to specify this parameter.  </p>

<p><strong><code>lineFrequencies</code></strong><br>
A vector of frequencies in Hz of the approximate locations of the line noise peaks to remove. By default, PREP removes multiples of 60 Hz up to the Nyquist frequency (which is half of the sampling frequency). After looking at the spectrum in the report, you may need to redo PREP with additional frequencies. If the data was recorded in a location using a 50 Hz power, you will also need to override.  </p>

<p>The clean line noise procedure used in PREP can only remove sharp peaks with minimal spectral distortion. It does not remove broad peaks. If the PREP reports show that line noise has not been removed to a sufficient extent, you may have to perform additional filtering for a particular application.  </p>

<p><strong><code>p</code></strong><br>
A significance cutoff level for removing a spectral peak. By default, PREP uses a p-value of 0.01. The clean line noise
procedure applies a F-test to determine whether a particular spectral peak is significantly higher than the background level in a small window. You should not have to override this parameter.  </p>

<p><strong><code>fScanBandWidth</code></strong><br>
Half of the width of the frequency band centered on each line frequency. This band is used to search
for the exact value of the maximum amplitude frequency peak near the specified frequencies to be removed. 
By default, PREP uses 2 Hz. You should not have to override this parameter.  </p>

<p><strong><code>taperBandWidth</code></strong><br>
Bandwidth in Hz for the Sleppian tapers used to estimate the spectrum. By default, PREP
uses 2 Hz. You should not have to override this parameter.  </p>

<p><strong><code>taperWindowSize</code></strong><br>
Taper sliding window length in seconds. By default, PREP uses 4 seconds. You should not have to override this parameter.  </p>

<p><strong><code>taperWindowStep</code></strong><br>
Taper sliding window step length in seconds. By default, PREP uses 1 second. You should not have to override this parameter.  </p>

<p><strong><code>tau</code></strong><br>
The window overlap smoothing factor used in the exponent of the signmoidal smoothing functions. This sigmoidal smoothing function is used to patch results from sliding windows back together. By default, PREP uses a value of 100. You should not have to override this parameter.  </p>

<p><strong><code>pad</code></strong><br>
Padding factor for FFTs (-1= no padding, 0 = pad to next power of 2, 1 = pad to power of two after, etc.).
By default, PREP uses a pad factor of 0. A larger positive value gives better spectral results, but requires
much greater computation time. Using a pad value of -1 is not recommended. You should not have to override this parameter.  </p>

<p><strong><code>fPassBand</code></strong><br>
The frequency band (in units of Hz) used to compute the spectral background. By default, PREP
uses <code>[0, Fs/2]</code>. You may need to adjust this range to get better spectral estimates.</p>

<p><strong><code>maximumIterations</code></strong><br>
The maximum number of times that PREP applies the cleaning process to remove line noise. When a particular peak
is not significantly above the background, it is removed from consideration. When no significant peaks remain, PREP
stops the procedure. Most of the time, only a few iterations are required.  You should not have to override this parameter.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="robust-referencing" class="anchor" href="#robust-referencing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Robust referencing</h2>

<p>Referencing is the process of subtracting a common reference signal from all of the channels. Data sets collected
from Biosemi headsets require referencing of some sort. Other headsets benefit as well. When comparing results across
data sets it is important to use the same referencing strategy.  </p>

<p>The PREP pipeline using robust average reference. This process is the same as average referencing (subtracting 
the average of the channels from each channel in each frame) provided the data set does not have any bad
channels.  However, if even if just a single channel has artifacts, the average reference can introduce
errors.  To address this, the robust reference iteratively detects and interpolates bad channels to arrive at an
average reference that is not affected by artifacts.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="calling-sequence-for-referencing" class="anchor" href="#calling-sequence-for-referencing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Calling sequence for referencing</h3>

<p>The <code>performReference</code> function takes two structures in and produces two output structures. The signal structure
includes a <code>.data</code> field and an <code>.srate</code> field. The <code>signal</code> structure is compatible with an EEGLAB EEG structure, but does not rely on any of the other EEGLAB fields. The data field should be channels x frames. </p>

<p>As with all functions in the pipeline, the algorithm parameters are passed in a structure.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>[signal, referenceOut] = performReference(signal, referenceIn)</code><br>
<code>[signal, referenceOut] = performReference(signal)</code>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The output structure contains all of the input structure fields plus many additional fields containing the 
reports of the output of the bad channel detection. Details in the document on PREP reporting.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>referenceIn = struct('referenceeChannels', [1:32, 40:60]);</code>  </p>
